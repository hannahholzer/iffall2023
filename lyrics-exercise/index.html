    <b style=color:#886593> [Verse 1]</b><br>
    In the end, it's stronger than I know how to be<br>
    And I can't just spend my whole lifetime wondering<br>
    I fell in love with the sound of my heels on the wooden floor<br>
    I don't want my footsteps to be silent anymore<br>
</p>
<p>
    <b style=color:#886593>[Pre-Chorus]</b><br>
    Want them to be in the moment<br>
    Storm clouds are closing<br>
</p>
<p>
    <b style=color:#886593> [Verse 2]</b><br>
    In the end, it’s coming, there’s nothing left to do <br>
    But I'm still not certain, just how I'm gonna feel <br>
</p>
<p>
    <b style=color:#886593> [Pre-Chorus]</b><br>
    I'll only know in the moment (Ooh) <br>
    Anticipation growing (Ooh) <br>
</p>
<p>
    <b style=color:#886593> [Chorus] </b><br>
    It's getting closer <br>
    Ooh, it's getting closer <br>
    It's getting closer (I'm not ready yet) <br>
    Ooh, it's getting closer (I need a little more time)  <br>
</p>
<p>
    <b style=color:#886593>[Instrumental Bridge]</b>
</p>
<p>
    <b style=color:#886593> [Chorus]</b> <br>
    It's getting closer (Closer, every day, don't cry, we'll be okay) <br>
    Ooh, it's getting closer (Closer, wall of the dam, hold on and breathe if you can) <br>
    It's getting closer (Closer; I'm not ready yet) <br>
    Ooh, it's getting closer (Closer- breathe if you can; I need a little more time) <br>
    It's getting closer (Closer; I'm not ready yet) <br>
    It's getting closer (Closer; I need a little more time) <br>
</p>
<p>
    <b style=color:#886593> [Outro] <br></b>
    It's getting closer <br>
    Ooh, it's getting closer <br>
