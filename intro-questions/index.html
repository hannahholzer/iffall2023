<h1><i>Introductory Questions</i></h1><body>
<ol type="1">
  <li><b>Provide your name, major, year in school (sophomore, junior, etc).<br></b>
    My name is Hannah Holzer! I am currently a Sophomore studying Marketing and Finance with a minor in Design.</b></li><br>
  <li><b>
    Tell us a bit about your background and what prompted you to take this class.</b><br> 
    Last year, I took CSE 131, and to my surprise, discovered a genuine liking for coding. However, I wanted to be in an environment where I could witness the practical outcomes of my code.
  In addition, I have an appreciation for design and currently hold the role of Campus Life Student Marketing Manager, specializing in Output and Design. During the summer, I worked for startup where I actively contributed to their social media design.
  My decision to enroll in this class is primarily driven by my curiosity regarding the intersection between technical coding and creative design.
  </li><br><li><b>
    Do you have any experience with HTML/CSS/JS? If so, tell us a bit about it.<br></b>
  No, I do not have any experience in HTML/CSS/JS! I only have a basic knowledge of Java.<br>
  </li><br><li><b>
    Name one thing you hope to learn in this class. </b><br>
    In this class, I hope to learn the differences in how to build websites for mobile and desktop screens. Over the summer, our startup ran into issues with making sure the user experience was as seamless on mobile devices as on desktop.
  </li><br><li><b>
    Name one way you expect designing for screen to be different from designing for paper. </b><br>
  I expect designing for the screen to pose challenges due to, as I mentioned above, different screen sizes and resolutions. If you are printing a flyer, you know what size is going to be used and can adjust your design for a few different dimensions. In web design, however, there could be thousands of screen sizes that you will have to account for.
  </li><br> <b><li>
   Provide a link to a website you think exemplifies effective design. Explain your choice.</b><br>
      <a href="https://www.apple.com/apple-card/">Apple's website,</a> especially the pages that feature one product / service, is one of my favorite web designs. The flowy and luxury feel is fitting for their brand. The website is also colorful and interactive, making the user excited about what they are looking at. 
  </li><br><li><b>
  Provide a link to a website you think exemplifies effective communication. Explain your choice.</b><br>
  <b><a href="https://www.chipotle.com/">Chipotle's website</a></b> effectively communicates a range of things that a customer may desire. Their <a href="https://www.chipotle.com/values">"Our Values"</a> page is thoughfully designed, but it effectively communicates by utilizing short blocks of text and engaging images. The <a href="https://www.chipotle.com/order/">"Order"</a> page is first on the top menu bar and makes the customer experience easier by having images of each item on the menu. 
</li><br>
  <li><b>Provide a link to a website you think works well. Explain your choice.</b><br>
  <a href="https://wustl.edu/ ">WashU's</a> website is very easy to navigate. From the top of the page, the website can direct certain audiences to the pages that they desire. Furthermore, the page gives a nice summary of WashU for someone who is just looking for a broad view of the university.
